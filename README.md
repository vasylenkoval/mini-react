# mini-react
A work-in-progress re-implementation of React originally based on Rodrigo Pombo's [Build your own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) article. The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how React works by implementing a subset of public APIs related to functional components and hooks.
